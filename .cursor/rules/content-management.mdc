# Content Management and Summarization

Content processing is managed by the [ContentManager](mdc:src/content_manager.py) class. This system:

- Stores and tracks all extracted content as LangChain Documents, with source attribution and metadata for each item
- Chunks content using RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (configurable chunk size/overlap in [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml))
- Generates hierarchical summaries: first for each chunk, then combines them for a full summary using LLMs
- Supports progressive loading: initially provides summaries, loads full content only when needed
- Handles both web and document (e.g., PDF) content

See [content_manager.py](mdc:src/content_manager.py) for implementation details and [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml) for relevant settings.
