# Configuration Guide

All major configuration for CleverBee is managed in [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml). This file controls:

- **Model selection** (primary, summarizer, next-step LLMs)
- **Summarization settings** (models, token limits, chunking)
- **Content processing and memory** (chunk size, overlap, progressive loading)
- **Web search and browser settings** (limits, timeouts, CAPTCHA solver)
- **Tool enable/disable** (web browser, Reddit tools, etc.)
- **Token usage tracking and pricing**
- **Logging level**

Configuration is read at runtime and some settings (e.g., local model usage, chunk size) may be auto-detected or overridden by `setup.sh` based on your environment. See comments in [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml) for detailed options and recommendations.
