# Playwright Browser Tool

The [PlaywrightBrowserTool](mdc:src/browser.py) provides automated web browsing and content extraction for the agent. Key features:

- Used for both web search and direct content extraction from URLs
- Supports actions: search, navigate_and_extract, extract, search_next_page
- Extracts main content from HTML (using readability/markdownify) and PDFs (using PyMuPDF)
- Handles CAPTCHAs automatically if Recognizer is available and enabled in [config.yaml](mdc:config.yaml)
- Integrates with the agent for web research and content gathering
- Tracks token usage for extracted content
- Handles errors gracefully for unsupported or problematic content types

See [browser.py](mdc:src/browser.py) for implementation details and configuration options.
